                    Today four countries stand on the brink of famine.<br />
                    Never before has so much of the world risked so many lives to hunger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What’s especially hard to bear is that these are predominantly man-made crises.<br />
                    The arid lands of the Horn of Africa and Yemen have long been unforgiving.<br />
                    It’s only where conflict is present that chronic food insecurity can escalate, as it has, towards the brink of famine.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Today 70 million people across six countries are in need of humanitarian assistance.<br />
                    More people than ever before are living life on the brink.

                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/SSD1.jpg">
                <p>
                    More than three years of brutal conflict has resulted in widespread hunger, large-scale displacement, and the loss of agriculture and livestock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    February’s declaration of famine in South Sudan – made jointly by three UN agencies – was the first anywhere in the world for six years. 100,000 people in Unity State are facing starvation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In total, 5.9 million people are in need of urgent help across the country – this is set to rise to 6.5 million at the peak of the lean season in June.
                </p>

                <!--Case Study-->
                <h3>Nine long minutes</h3>
                <p>
                    The oversized oxygen mask covered her tiny face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her breathing – which at first radiated pain – began to soften as she slept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jessica, a paediatric nurse from the International Committee of the Red Cross, swayed gently as she cradled the girl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At five months old, little Nyanene was tiny – barely the size of a newborn baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m so happy to see her sleep,” said Jessica. “She’s been through so much.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the background, a wounded air conditioner puffed limply, struggling against the heavy air in the emergency room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, suddenly, the light in the room dropped from green fluorescent to grey shadow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generator died and with it Nyanene’s oxygen supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jessica jumped up, checking her heart rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If it’s under 60 we start CPR,” Jessica said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Holding an airbag in her hands, Jessica pumped breaths into the child’s body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gbang, her assistant, pressed his two thumbs deep into the baby’s chest, pumping its heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re going 15 minutes before we call it, okay?” said Jessica, before adding with calm, “that’s really good. You’re doing a really good job.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we get the generator back on? A call is made but the dark remains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you check the heart rate? What’s the heart rate? Jessica relieved Gbang and started pressing her thumbs into Nyanene’s chest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This baby, the one Jessica knew was hungry for life, wasn’t responding. Her young mother sat on the bed, within arm’s length of her child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the clock ticked over to 2.20pm, Jessica, collecting herself for a beat, turned to her left and touched the mother’s leg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moments later, just nine minutes after cutting out, the fluorescent lights flicker on. Nine minutes was sadly too long for little Nyanene.
                </p>

                    <h3>Reaching the most vulnerable</h3>

                    <p>
                        Hospitals in South Sudan are full of children like Nyanene and their families. Many are suffering from malnutrition, malaria, and the devastating effects of violence in their war-torn country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Red Cross is one of a few humanitarian agencies able to reach South Sudan’s most vulnerable people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In December 2016, the Red Cross distributed emergency food to 11,000 families in Leer, Unity state – the epicentre of South Sudan’s famine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeds and tools were distributed to some 5,000 households in the surrounding area. Fishing kits, tarpaulins and mosquito nets went to almost 3,000 households.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was made possible thanks to the constant dialogue with all parties involved in the conflict.
                    </p>
                    Last year the Red Cross also:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distributed over 950,000 food rations – some 13,000 tonnes of food – the equivalent in weight of more than 1,000 double decker buses,   </li>
                        <li>Provided nearly 234,000 people with seeds and tools for farming, and some 90,500 people with fishing kits,                              </li>
                        <li>Vaccinated or treated some 1.1 million heads of livestock to help communities rebuild their livelihoods,                                </li>
                        <li>Helped 100,000 people gain access to safe drinking water.                                                                               </li>

                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Somalia1.jpg">
                <p>
                    The spectre of famine has again reared its head in Somalia, only six years after a devastating famine killed more than a quarter of a million people in the east African nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two consecutive poor rainy seasons have resulted in severe water shortages. Thousands of animals – essential for people’s livelihoods – have perished due to the lack of water and pasture. Crops too have failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rainy season is due to begin in April. If the rains fail again, then famine is a very real prospect. But even if the rains do come, they will do little to alleviate the suffering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The UN estimates that up to 6.2 million people are in need of urgent help – over half of Somalia’s population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Large numbers of people are on the move searching for food and water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parts of the country are also blighted by protracted conflict. Where the fighting is preventing humanitarian agencies from reaching people in need, the situation is particularly severe.
                </p>

                <h3>A lifeline for children</h3>
                <p>
                    More than 70,000 children are at risk of dying from the most severe form of malnutrition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At five months old, little Abdikaafi is one of them.

                <p>
                    The Red Cross is supporting specialist malnutrition centres across the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many cases, they are the difference between a mother’s joy and a mother’s grief.

                <p>
                    After years of conflict, severe food shortages are now a reality in north-eastern Nigeria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some 5.1 million people are currently affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conflict has uprooted more than 2 million as people move in search of safety and food, both within Nigeria and across borders in the region surrounding Lake Chad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around 90 per cent of those have found shelter with host communities that are among the poorest in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has placed great pressure on already weak infrastructure and resources, giving way to disease and food shortages.

                    When one-year-old Aboubacar was weighed at the state hospital, he weighed only 10.4 pounds – the average weight of a 1-month-old baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His family had made it to an informal camp outside Maiduguri after fleeing violence a few months earlier. But since arriving, they had struggled to find enough food to survive.

                <p>
                    Sixteen days after first arriving in hospital, Aboubacar sadly died.

                <p>
                    Across the region, other families face similar anguish.

                <p>
                    Conflict has left nearly 70 per cent of Yemen’s population in need of humanitarian aid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than 14 million people do not have enough food, including 3.3 million mothers and children who are acutely malnourished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The situation is particularly serious in areas of the country where the fighting is most brutal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is almost no food available in some places and the insecurity means humanitarian agencies cannot reach people in need.

                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/KEN1.jpg">
                <p>
                    Northern and parts of coastal Kenya are severely affected by recurrent drought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lack of rainfall, which has led to crop failure and livestock deaths, has doubled the number of Kenyans living without adequate food supplies from 1.6 million to 2.7 million in just six months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around 85,000 children are severely acutely malnourished and are at risk of dying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Kenyan government has declared a national emergency and has asked for international support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of food shortages, Kenya has been affected by outbreaks of cholera – a potentially fatal disease – over the last two years.
                </p>

                <h3 class="header-name">"Everyone in the village is sick"</h3>
                <p>
                    Thirty years after building his school with his bare hands, head teacher Bonaya Jillo is now struggling to keep it running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A third of Bonaya’s 138 students have dropped out because of the drought this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many more are on the verge of doing the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make life better here but there are so many obstacles,” said 52-year-old Bonaya. “I do not have an office, we do not have electrics, but the main problem at the moment is water.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the water points are either dried up or dirty. It’s having a severe impact on teaching and learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Almost everyone in the village is sick,” continued Bonaya. “Many pupils did not come to school today because they are sick, they have stomach ache, the entire village has stomach ache. So many people in our village are sick, all because of water.”

                        The Kenya Red Cross is currently supporting more than 340,000 people in the 13 worst-affected counties of Kenya.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as distributing food and helping people to access clean water and hygiene facilities, the Red Cross is buying cattle that would otherwise die.

                    <p>
                        This gives the farmers a source of income and the meat is donated to the community.

                    Ethiopia has also been blighted by the same drought affecting Somalia and Kenya.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poor rainfall is expected in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country in the coming months, putting further pressure on water and pasture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In total, 5.6 million people are food insecure in the country. Up to 9.2 million people are struggling to drink safe and clean water.
                </p>
                <h3 class="header-name">A dire situation</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Afar district in northern Ethiopia, people have been hoping in vain for much need rainfall. Severe drought has ruined harvests right across the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The drought makes access to food difficult in this country where the majority of people make their living from farming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The main income and livelihood in Afar is cattle, but almost all the cows have now died. Even the goats are running out of food. The situation is very dire,” said Marjo Leppänen, who works in logistics for the Red Cross in Ethiopia.
                </p>

                        Leppänen is in Ethiopia to distribute food and water to the worst hit areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the last year, the Red Cross has also treated 56,000 children and pregnant and lactating women for malnutrition.

                    <p>
                        We have also given seeds and agricultural tools to 83,000 people and improved access to water for 78,200 people.
